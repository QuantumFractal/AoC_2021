""" 
    Couldn't be bothered to clean this up honestly, a lot of the logic
    here is worked out by hand, figuring a method to extract the mapping 
    between scrambled letters to number. 

    The number "one" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Since numbers like
    2 or 5 have the same number of segments, but are flipped, we can use the
    fact that number 1 contains a set of the right two segments. 

    We can then deduce 9 and 6 based on which set represents number 5. Since 5's
    segments is a subset of both 9 and 6. We can also use this to figure out which
    string is 0.
