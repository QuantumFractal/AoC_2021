# Look! Another Advent of Code Repo!

This time written in Julia.

Well folks, it's that time of year again.
Time for the Advent of Code.

I tried to make this Julia package _kind of_ easy to read, by no means best practices.
I'll _try_ to leave some comments explaining some of the fancier Julia stuff
and I might even try to finish all the challenges this year!
